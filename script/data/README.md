# Script Data

## `foundry-modules.json`

A dump of Foundry's module package listing, as used internally by the Setup page to render the "Install Module" dialogue. While this _could_ be pulled as part of any script that requires it, the Foundry team has politely requested that this not be done. While this dump will quickly grow stale, the modules we care about are stable enough that manually re-dumping from time-to-time is not (yet) a problem.
